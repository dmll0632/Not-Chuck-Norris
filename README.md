**Analyzing the Correlation Between GDP and Video Game Sales**

**Project Description**

In this project, we embarked on an analytical journey to investigate the relationship between a country's economic performance and its video game sales. Utilizing two distinct datasets—one comprising video game sales data and the other containing GDP values sourced from the World Bank API—we aimed to test the hypothesis that higher GDP correlates with higher video game sales. Additionally, we explored whether increases in a country's GDP correspond with increased video game sales over time and examined the influence of cultural factors on these sales patterns.

**Objectives**

Correlation Analysis: To determine if there is a significant correlation between higher GDP and higher video game sales across different countries and regions.
Trend Analysis: To observe the trend of video game sales in relation to changes in GDP values within individual countries or regions over time.
Cultural Impact: To investigate how cultural factors may affect video game sales in various regions.
Methodology:
